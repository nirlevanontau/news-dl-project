# dl-project
Project performed during a course in Advanced Subjects in Deep Learning

## Setup

In order to run the environment, first create the virtual environment by running the following command inside of the root directory:

`python -m virtualenv venv`

Afterwards, activate the virtual environment by running:

`venv\Scripts\activate`

And then install dependencies by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 1. News Data Setup

Add the `ireland-news-headlines.csv` file manually to the `data` directory. It can't be uploaded directly to the repository because of it's size.

## 2. Run Visualisation Notebook

Run the `visualisation.ipynb` notebook to generate the visualisations and create the `DataFrame`s that can be later used for the 2nd part of the project.
